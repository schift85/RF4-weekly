App for RF4 weekly records - filtering by region and by rod type


I made an app for russian fishing 4 game.

The application loads the current weekly records from the website https://rf4game.com/.

Subsequently, the data can be filtered according to the selected location and type of rod

Installation: Unpack .rar file and run RF4App.exe.

Please do not change the data folder or the files in it. The application may not work correctly.
